## Installation

 - Installed phidget22 directly into the resources folder. If it works it might be a beautiful solution. However, there might be some potential conflicts with the fidget control panel when it tries to fetch its own libraries. In such a case then
 1. Try to change the environmental variables of the fidget control panel
 2. If this is not possible, perhaps due to not being directly accessible, then revert and do it the traditional way. 

#### Test - phidget library include ok
Result: Not performed
